### Cancer-promoting N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) sites prediction
Labeled 111,937 experimentally validated m<sup>6</sup>A sites that were associated with cancer development and developed a
prediction model using SVM with AUROC of around 82%. Implemented several models, including random forest, naive bayes, and decision tree, and determined that
the SVM model outperformed in terms of accuracy, and thus selected it for the final m6A-CAPred model. Validated our predicted cancer-promoting m<sup>6</sup>A sites through SNP density analysis. A freely accessible web server that allows real-time analysis of user-uploaded sites can be accessed at: http://www.rnamd.org/m6A-CAPred/.
